# Weather-Forecast-App

## Description

The motivation behind this project is to utilize server-side APIs in order to create an application with functional features. This project idea is to provide and display the current weather and forecast the next 5 days based on user inputs. Weather Forecast App was a great opportunity to practice fetching and pulling data from multiple API, and practicing the materials we covered in class. Furthermore, this application will solve the problem for any user who want to plan out their day ahead.
